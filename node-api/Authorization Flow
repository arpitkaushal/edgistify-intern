First Step 
    A request is sent to update profile 
    The URL will look like "domain/profile/userid21900213"

    When there is userid in the incoming request
        based on that user id
        our backend will make a query to DB and load that user info
        then we will add that info to the request object
        like - req.profile = userInformation

Second Step 
    add middleware requireSignin() so that we know that the user is authenticated

Third Step 
    create hasAuthorization()
    to make sure that req object has 
        req.profile &&
        req.auth    &&
        req.profile._id === req.auth._id
